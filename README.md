### Developer Notes
Tried to add MongoDB, structure of the database required a lot of associations, so I decide to move all project to JPA.
Tried to add Lombok, but have some issue with Java 9, required fix was already pulled to the github repository of the Lombok project, but was not added to the last build on Maven Central.
